# Project Title

ICI Qualifier

## Project Description

The objectives of this project are intended for users, particularly high school students who are unclear of their qualifications yet wish to apply to the Department of the International College of Innovation (ICI). The personal statements of applicants to ICI would serve as the data. The analytical methods
can help you to evaluate your strengths, experiences, and skills to determine if you are a suitable candidate or not. Our goals is to empowers the user to assess their qualification for the ICI program objectively and make informed decisions regarding their application, but the admissions committee retains the final say. It provides a structured approach to self-reflection and evaluation that might improve applicants' likelihood of making a strong application or or point out prospective areas for improvement.
